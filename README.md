# UserManagementSystem.github.io
User Management System in Java using REST API and Postman for data fetching.

Project Setup:
Start by setting up a new Java project using your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

Dependencies:
You'll need to include the necessary dependencies to create a REST API. Common libraries include:

Spring Boot: For creating the RESTful API.
Spring Data JPA: For handling data access and persistence.
H2 Database (optional): For setting up an in-memory database for testing.
Maven or Gradle: For managing project dependencies.
User Entity:
Create a User class that represents the user entity. This class will have attributes like id, username, password, etc. Implement appropriate getters and setters.

Data Access Layer:
Set up a repository (e.g., using Spring Data JPA) to handle data access for the User entity. This repository will allow you to perform CRUD operations on the User data.

REST Controller:
Create a REST controller that will handle HTTP requests related to user management. This controller should have methods to handle GET (fetch user by ID or all users), POST (create a new user), PUT (update user details), and DELETE (delete a user) requests.

REST Endpoints:
Define the REST endpoints for each of the CRUD operations in your controller. For example:

@GetMapping("/all-users")- Get a list of all users.
@PostMapping("/delete-user/{soe-id}")-delete the user ID.
@PostMapping("/registration")-Register new user.
@PostMapping("/update-user/{soe-id}/{first-name}/{last-name}/{city}")-update user deatils.
@PostMapping("/view-details/{soe-id}")-view user details.
@RequestMapping("/login")-login user with id.

Testing with Postman:
Now that your REST API is set up, you can use Postman to test the endpoints. Open Postman and create requests for each of the defined endpoints. 



Remember that this is just a brief overview, and building a full-fledged User Management System involves more details and considerations. However, this should give you a starting point to work on your Java-based User Management System with REST API and Postman for data fetching.
